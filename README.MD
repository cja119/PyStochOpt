PyStochOpt is an indexing and sampling module, primarily designed to aid in building stochastic energy systems models in python. This module is build in rust and can be used to remove the need for computationally expensive non anticipativity constraints. See the theory section for more!

## Quickstart
This module is built in rust in order to leverage parallelisation to vastly improve execution speeds. As such it is necessary to install rust on your local machine to use this package. 
### Step 1: Install Rust

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to install Rust using `rustup` (the Rust toolchain installer):

    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
4. After installation, ensure that Rust is installed correctly by running:

    ```sh
    rustc --version
    ```

    This should display the version of Rust installed.

### Step 2: Install Maturin

1. With Rust installed, you can now install Maturin. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```sh
    pip install maturin
    ```
    This should display the version of Maturin installed.

For more information, refer to the official documentation:
- [Rust Documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)
- [Maturin Documentation](https://maturin.rs/)

### Step 3: Clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cja119/bfgs.git
```
### Step 4: Build The Module

```sh
maturin develop
```

This should succesfully build the module and store it in your native python location (pay attention to which location it prints when the module is built)

### Step 5: Run The Module

At this stage, only a jupyter notebook is provided (streamlit capabilities will be extended in due course), but modify the test functions, such as rosenbrock, and observe the trajectory generated by the optimisation algorithm.
